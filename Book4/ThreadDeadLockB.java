/*
* This program demonstrates and exmaple how deadlock occurs and how to avoid deadlocks
* 
* Concept--
* DeadLock occurs when there is sharing of resources between two threads
* synchronized block is used to lock the resources
* 
* Synchronized block can be 
* 1)Static/Non-static method can be Synchronized
* 2)Static/ Non-static blocks can be Synchronized
* Synchronized block cannot be
* 1) Classes
* 2) Declaration 
* 
* 
* How to Avoid DeadLocks--
* 1) Mutual Exclusion
* 2) Hold and Wait
* 3) No preemption
* 4) Circular Wait
* 
* Explanation--
* This program below create two thread -- Thread1 and Thread2
* Thread1 gets access to train object and is locked while Thread2
* also gets access to compartment object later both the Threads wait for 
* train and compartment to be released. Due this reason we get errenuos 
* output.
* 
* Solution--
* Now in this program the Thread1 get the access to train object and locks it.
* While Thread2 waits for Thread 1 to get over and get the lock from Thread1
* So by Hold and wait technique DeadLock problem is solved.
* 
*
